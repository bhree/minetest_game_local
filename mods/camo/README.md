DoYouSketch2 a.k.a Sketch2 added the menu to the turrets from:

Calinou's Carbone game Protector mod,
based on glomie's mod, remade by Zeg9 
and reworked by TenPlus1


Sketch2 incorporated edits put forward by the community on the forum.

Thanks to:

ownsyouall for the group:leaves instead of default:leaves idea.

Jonathan for turret code that doesn't shoot owner.

Jouster27 for the fixed Stone glass recipe.


Other edits by Sketch2:

Manual alarm now has a smaller radius of 5.

Intruder alarm has an increased alarm sound of 50.
The radius it protects is still 15,
you can just hear it at a greater distance.

It also doesn't fall so that it doesn't lose its owner metadata.
